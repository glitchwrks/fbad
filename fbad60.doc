			FINDBAD V6.0
			------------

The only modification from V5.9 is that ^C really does let you
abort the program now.

Also included in the LBR is a file called BIOS2RSX.RSX which is
an RSX for CP/M Plus that will allow FBAD to work on CP/M Plus
operating systems.  In order to use FBAD on CP/M Plus you must
attach the RSX to FBAD.COM as follows:

GENCOM FBAD60 BIOS2RSX

Then the resultant FBAD60.COM will then run properly on CP/M Plus
but will not run on CP/M V2.2 or earlier without removing the RSX.
